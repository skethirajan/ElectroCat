## Summary
A clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see in ElectroCat.

## Problem/Use Case
Describe the electrochemical analysis problem or use case this feature would address. For example:
- What type of catalyst system are you studying? (molecular, surface, hybrid)
- What solvation/ionic conditions are you working with?
- What analysis workflow is currently difficult or impossible?

## Proposed Solution
A clear description of what you want to happen. Please include:
- How the feature would integrate with existing ElectroCat modules
- Expected input/output formats
- Any specific electrochemical properties or metrics to be calculated

## Implementation Details (if known)
- Preferred API design or function signatures
- Dependencies on external packages (ASE, pymatgen, etc.)
- Performance considerations for large catalyst systems

## Alternative Solutions
Describe any alternative approaches you've considered, including:
- Workarounds you're currently using
- Other software tools that provide similar functionality
- Different algorithmic approaches

## Additional Context
- Examples of input structures or data
- Literature references for the proposed method
- Screenshots, diagrams, or mockups
- Compatibility requirements with specific file formats (VASP etc.)
